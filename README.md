<p>Hello, everyone! I hope you, who reads this, is doing great today. My name's Paulo Suchoj (the j is read as an i), and I’m always looking for both career and personal growth. My long-time objective is to achieve a specialist position in the IAM field. I love data and analytics, and I believe the skillset of a data analyst can be used in any area or team, so currently that's also one of main focuses in studying and practicing.</p>
<p>As for my background, I'm a technology professional in the information security field with a focus on IAM, but I've been around many areas and departments within many organizations. I have extensive experience in customer support, systems and NOC monitoring and incident management.</p>
<p>I always strive to learn from my more experienced peers, teach what I know and encourage the sharing of knowledge and experiences through actions in my team, so that we can grow as a team and individually as professionals. I aim to do my best at every moment to deliver everything I set out to do with excellence.</p>
